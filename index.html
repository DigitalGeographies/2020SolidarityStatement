Geographies Specialty Group (DGSG), wish to collectively issue a statement of
solidarity with the Movement for Black Lives and support anti-racist
protestors, marches, and online actions. We issue this statement following the

solidarity.</span></p>

Association of Geographers, we unequivocally support our association’s
statement condemning the recent murders of George Floyd, <span class=SpellE>Ahmaud</span>
<span class=SpellE>Arbery</span>, Breonna Taylor, and countless other Black
Americans. We also condemn these violent, hateful, racist actions. We recognize
that centuries of anti-Black policies and perversely unjust systems have
embedded racism as a foundation of American society, and that many of our
institutes of higher education were built on similarly racist, sexist,
colonialist, homophobic, and ableist foundations. We also recognize that these
issues are not contained within certain political boundaries, that racism and
racist actions are present in every corner of the globe, and that the flows of
these ideas and actions are accelerated through digital conduits and online
communities. These structures need to change, and we commit ourselves to
working together, in support of active change in our lecture halls, research
teams, academic governance structures, and in our communities. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Digital Geographies Specialty Group is
instituting a small research grant to contribute funding to current or
prospective work in the area of racial justice in the context of digital
geographies. The DGSG is dedicated to exploring relations between digital
technologies and socio-spatial relations in their multiple manifestations. In
this vein, we recognize that it is urgent to further geographical work that
elucidates the linkages between digital technologies and the spatial
expressions of racialized systems of domination, as well as contribute towards
delineating paths for liberation, equity, and justice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>This call is a response to the worldwide wave
of manifestations for racial justice, and it is also part of the DGSG’s
acknowledgment of the work that we must undertake to transform our own
discipline and academic institutions. For these reasons, the DGSG is committing
to awarding a total of $1000 in grants to emerging geographers (graduate
students, postdoctoral scholars, and non-tenured faculty) who are presently
conducting or preparing to undertake work in this area. Please send proposals
of 1-2 pages in length to <a href="mailto:luis.f.alvarez.leon@dartmouth.edu"><span
style='color:#1155CC'>luis.f.alvarez.leon@dartmouth.edu</span></a> by September
1st, 2020. Existing research projects (with work completed during the summer of
2020) are eligible.</span></p>
