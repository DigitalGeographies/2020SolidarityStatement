<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Digital Geographies Specialty Group is
instituting a small research grant to contribute funding to current or
prospective work in the area of racial justice in the context of digital
geographies. The DGSG is dedicated to exploring relations between digital
technologies and socio-spatial relations in their multiple manifestations. In
this vein, we recognize that it is urgent to further geographical work that
elucidates the linkages between digital technologies and the spatial
expressions of racialized systems of domination, as well as contribute towards
delineating paths for liberation, equity, and justice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>This call is a response to the worldwide wave
of manifestations for racial justice, and it is also part of the DGSGâ€™s
acknowledgment of the work that we must undertake to transform our own
discipline and academic institutions. For these reasons, the DGSG is committing
to awarding a total of $1000 in grants to emerging geographers (graduate
students, postdoctoral scholars, and non-tenured faculty) who are presently
conducting or preparing to undertake work in this area. Please send proposals
of 1-2 pages in length to <a href="mailto:luis.f.alvarez.leon@dartmouth.edu"><span
style='color:#1155CC'>luis.f.alvarez.leon@dartmouth.edu</span></a> by October
1st, 2020. Existing research projects (with work completed during the summer of
2020) are eligible.</span></p>
